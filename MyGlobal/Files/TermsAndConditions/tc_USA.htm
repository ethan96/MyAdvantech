<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Advantech Standard Terms 
  and Conditions - 010107<br>
  <br>
  </b>1. <u>PRICE QUOTATIONS</u><br>
  a. Unless otherwise stated on the face of the quotation, or otherwise agreed 
  to in writing by Advantech, all quotations expire thirty (30) days after the 
  date of the quotation. All prices quoted are valid for the period stated only 
  if buyers requested delivery date (including any change orders) on any resultant 
  purchase order or commitment is within six (6) months of the expiration date 
  on the original quotation.<br>
  b. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Advantech, all prices quoted are 
  exclusive of transportation and insurance costs, and any and all taxes including, 
  but not limited to, state and local use, sales, property (ad valorem) and similar 
  taxes. Buyer agrees to pay such taxes unless buyer has provided Advantech with 
  an exemption resale certificate in the appropriate form for the jurisdiction 
  of buyer's place of business and any jurisdiction to which equipment is to be 
  directly shipped hereunder, or unless such sale is otherwise exempt from such 
  taxes. When applicable, such transportation and taxes shall appear as separate 
  items on Advantech's invoice.<br>
  <br>
  2. <u>PAYMENT AND SECURITY TERMS</u><br>
  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Advantech, buyer shall pay all invoices 
  issued within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice. Advantech reserves 
  the right to change its standard credit terms at any time when, in Advantech's 
  opinion, buyer's financial condition or previous payment record so warrants.<br>
  <br>
  Should buyer become delinquent in the payment of any sum due Advantech, after 
  ten (10) days from the date of written notice to buyer Advantech shall not be 
  obligated to continue performance under any agreement with buyer. In addition, 
  Advantech shall have the right to seek recovery through any legal channel, and 
  buyer agrees to pay all costs associated with said recovery, plus interest at 
  the rate of 1.5% per month on any outstanding invoice amount.<br>
  <br>
  3. <u>DELIVERY DATES<br>
  </u>Shipments of any products purchased are subject to Advantech's availability 
  schedule. Advantech shall make every reasonable effort to meet any delivery 
  date(s) quoted or acknowledged. However, Advantech will not be liable for its 
  failure to meet such dates.<br>
  <br>
  4. <u>DELAYS IN PERFORMANCE</u><br>
  Advantech shall not be liable for any delay in performance or any other consequential 
  damages hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or due to causes beyond its 
  control including, but not limited to, acts of nature, acts of government, labor 
  disputes, delays in transportation, and delays in delivery or inability to deliver 
  by Advantech's suppliers.<br>
  <br>
  5. <u>SHIPMENT, RISK OF LOSS AND PACKING</u><br>
  a. All prices are F.O.B. shipping point unless otherwise agreed to in writing

  charges that, unless prepaid, shall be added, on a dollar for dollar basis, 
  to the invoice for the products being shipped.<br>
  b. Advantech shall make every effort to ship in accordance with buyer's shipping 
  instructions. In the absence of specific instructions, or if buyer's instructions 
  are deemed unsuitable, Advantech reserves the right to ship by the method it 
  deems most appropriate.<br>
  c. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Advantech, all products shall be 
  packed for shipment in accordance with standard commercial practices. All packing 
  will conform to requirements of carrier's tariffs.<br>
  d. Any discrepancies in shipment must be reported within 14 days of receipt 
  of product at the first point of delivery and as specified on the Advantech

  reveals Advantech is at fault. See the Advantech Policy for Shipping Damage 
  and Shortages.<br>
  e. A $15 handling fee plus freight will be charged for all refused shipments.<br>
  <br>
  6. <u>ORDER OF PRECEDENCE</u><br>
  a. These Terms and Conditions of Sale and any attachments take precedence over 
  buyer's additional or different terms and conditions, to which notice of objection 
  is hereby given. Acceptance by buyer is limited to these terms and conditions. 
  Neither Advantech's commencement of performance or delivery shall be deemed 
  or construed as acceptance of buyer's additional or different terms and conditions.<br>
  b. Buyer's purchase of Advantech products hereunder represents acceptance of 
  these Terms and Conditions of Sale and any attachments, which together constitute 
  the entire understanding between the parties and supersede any previous communications, 
  representations, or agreements by either party, whether verbal or written. No

  be treated as customer discretionary returns and restocking charges may apply.

  date, cannot be changed to a date beyond the end of the month in which it was 
  originally scheduled.<br>

  c. In addition, if buyer cancels an order for special equipment or services
